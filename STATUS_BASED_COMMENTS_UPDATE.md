# Status-Based Commenting and PDF Update

## Changes Summary

This update implements two key improvements to the Bid Management System:

### 1. **Removed Admin Notes from PDF**
- **Location**: `app.py` - PDF generation function (`download_pdf`)
- **Change**: Removed "Section 4: ADMIN NOTES" which previously displayed `vendor_justification`
- **Impact**: 
  - PDF now has 5 sections instead of 6
  - Admin notes are no longer visible in generated PDFs
  - Section numbering updated:
    - Section 1: Contract Information
    - Section 2: Bid Items
    - Section 3: Assigned Buyer Response
    - Section 4: Approval Workflow (was Section 5)
    - Section 5: Complete Audit Trail (was Section 6)

### 2. **Status-Based Comment Permissions**
Implemented permission controls so that only the appropriate approver can add comments based on the current bid status.

#### A1 Approver Template (`templates/a1_view_bid.html`)
- **Condition**: Comment forms only visible when `bid.status == 'Pending A1'`
- **When Pending A1**: Shows approve/reject forms with comment fields
- **When Other Status**: Shows informative message:
  ```
  "Comment Permissions: You can only add comments when the bid status is 'Pending A1'. 
  Current status: [badge showing current status]"
  ```

#### A2 Approver Template (`templates/a2_view_bid.html`)
- **Already implemented**: Template already had status-based logic
- **Updated**: Enhanced the else clause message for clarity
- **Condition**: Comment forms only visible when `bid.status == 'Pending A2'`
- **When Pending A2**: Shows approve/reject forms with comment fields
- **When Approved**: Shows PDF download and reopen options
- **When Other Status**: Shows informative message:
  ```
  "Comment Permissions: You can only add comments when the bid status is 'Pending A2'. 
  Current status: [badge showing current status]"
  ```

## Permission Flow

### Status-Based Access Control
1. **Awaiting Buyer** → Only Buyer can submit comments
2. **Pending A1** → Only A1 Approver can add comments (approve/reject)
3. **Pending A2** → Only A2 Approver can add comments (approve/reject)
4. **Approved** → Only A2 Approver can reopen with comment
5. **Other Statuses** → Informative message shown, no comment forms

### Backend Validation
The backend already has validation in place:
- `a1_approve_bid` and `a1_reject_bid` check if `bid['status'] == 'Pending A1'`
- `a2_approve_bid` and `a2_reject_bid` check if `bid['status'] == 'Pending A2'`
- Flash messages provide feedback if users try to act on wrong status

- [ ] Test A2 Approver view when status is "Pending A2" - should see comment forms
- [ ] Test A2 Approver view when status is "Pending A1" - should see permission message
- [ ] Test A2 Approver view when status is "Approved" - should see PDF download & reopen
- [ ] Download PDF for approved bid - verify Admin Notes section is removed
- [ ] Verify section numbering is correct in PDF (1-5 instead of 1-6)
